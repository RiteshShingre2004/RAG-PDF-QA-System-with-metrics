# 📄 RAG PDF Question Answering System with Evaluation Metrics

An **industry-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that allows users to ask natural language questions over PDF documents and receive **context-aware, grounded answers**, along with **automatic evaluation metrics**.

---

🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **PDF-based Question Answering system** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**.  
Relevant document chunks are retrieved from PDFs and passed to a **Gemini LLM** to generate accurate answers while tracking evaluation metrics.

This project demonstrates **real-world RAG system design, observability, and evaluation**, suitable for enterprise AI applications.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|------|------------|
| Context Relevance | Measures relevance of retrieved context to query |
| Faithfulness | Ensures answer is grounded in retrieved context |
| Completeness | Checks if the answer sufficiently covers the query |

These metrics help identify hallucinations and improve answer reliability.
